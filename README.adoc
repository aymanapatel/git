> Repo to learn Git and Githook

== Git 

=== Sync forked repository from upstream

link:git/sync-fork.adoc[Doc link]

== Java Gradle (`pre-commit`)

Running `./gradlew clean test` in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

== Python (`commit-msg`)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvpZkdkp-v0[Youtube Link]


=== Windows


=== UNIX/Linux
1. Symbolic link between `python/commit-msg.py` and `.git/hooks/commit-msg`
    - `install_hooks.bat` : Run this on Windows to create symbolic Link
    - `install_hooks.sh` : Run this on Mac/Linux to create symbolic Link
        - NOTE: hint: The '.git/hooks/commit-msg' hook was ignored because it's not set as executable.
                hint: You can disable this warning with `git config advice.ignoredHook false`.
        - Remember to do `chmod 777 install_hooks.sh` before `sudo ./install_hooks.sh`


== Node

npm has a package https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky[husky] for Git hooks.

Prettier (checkstyle but for node) has npm package (https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html[pretty-quick]) for use in Husky's pre-commit config.

== Topics to explore

=== How to use `checkstyle` in pre-commit
NOTE: It is harder on researching on google.
 


=== Type of githooks:
    - prehooks
    - prepush
    - etc
