> Manage multiple worktrees


```shell
git worktree add [-f] [--detach] [--checkout] [--lock] [-b <new-branch>] <path> [<commit-ish>]
git worktree list [--porcelain]
git worktree lock [--reason <string>] <worktree>
git worktree move <worktree> <new-path>
git worktree prune [-n] [-v] [--expire <expire>]
git worktree remove [-f] <worktree>
git worktree repair [<path>…​]
git worktree unlock <worktree>
```

== This Example

Say you are working on `feature1` and you get prod bug. Instead of switching repo and losing `feature1` changes OR doing `git stash` and `git stash pop` OR cloning repo(takes ages), you can use `git worktree` to add new branch.

This worktree will create new folder. Caveat is you can use `git worktree`  itself to add fix or prune
